#New York Times - React

## About This Program

This program allows a user to choose a topic to research with the New York Times.  The user chooses a topic and a range of dates within the New York Times archives to research from.  Once these selections are made, a list of articles related to the topic is given.  From this list, the user can select articles to read by clicking a button on the button which will link the user to the article on the New York Times API.  If the user wants to save this article for future reference, he can click a button that will save the article. 

Once an article is saved, it will be included in a database of other saved articles.  From this list, the user can link to the article or decide to delete the article from the collection.  

```
##A Clever Program
I love to research topics on the internet.  
*The New York Times API* is very useful and this program allows the user to take advantage of it.  
When I started college, I was thrilled with being able to use the computer for word processing so I could easily edit papers.  
Students in high schools nowadays will use videos from the internet as class instruction and homework.  
This New York Times API project is just as functional, new, and clever as those. You can research topics and then easily save articles that you can use later.

##How It Works

##Production
I started my project with a *Create React App* as a boilerplate.  I used current versions of *React* and *React-Router-Dom* for this assignment.  To save articles, I used a *MongoDB* database.  Also utilized were Node and Express.

## Deployment (Heroku)
My program is deployed on Heroku at  https://still-springs-95092.herokuapp.com/
